# Prin Test

Author: Prin S
Version: 1.0
Tested on: 6.2.2

## Description

The plugin was created to help me learn PHP and how to create WordPress plugins. I learned how to:
- Add functionality to the front-end
- Create a settings page
- Enqueue styles (CSS) and scripts (JS)
- Add and customize plugin menu in WP dashboard
- Create a custom post type
- Create a short code
- ...among other things.

I now also understand the words hooks, filters and actions, and how to use them.

Thank you Pippin's Plugins for very helpful tutorials!
